    "A fundamental difficulty of GPU programming, is that the GPU does not directly share the memory with the CPU. This means that we have to actively manage where data is placed as well as data movement. For example, if we want to print data on the GPU to the screen, the data has to be copied from the GPU memory to the CPU memory and only then we can display it on the screen. Inversely, if we have loaded a data set from disk, it will reside in the memory of the CPU. We have to explicitly copy the data to the GPU memory before we can work on it on the GPU.\n",

    "While GPUs are much faster than CPUs (higher peak FLOP/s and higher memory bandwidth), one of the main difficulties of GPU programming is making sure that the benefit of this faster processing speed is not offset by the overhead of moving the data from the CPU to the GPU and the results back.\n",

    "Computations on the GPU with CuPy are extremently convenient and powerful. But it is by far not the only or most common way that GPUs are being used (and as we've seen above also has its limitations). But why can we not simply use Fortran or C/C++ to program GPUs? The reason is the same as for parallel programing with OpenMP. Most programming languages have not been designed for parallel programming and additional information from the programmer is required because the compilers are (often) not able to automatically parallelize code written in Fortran or C/C++. Furthermore, the programmer also has to explicitly manage data transfers between the CPU and the GPU, in case performance is of any importance."

    "CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is an extension of the C/C++ programming language and can be used for programming GPUs from NVIDIA. Take a look at [this tutorial](https://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC-2010/pdfs/2131_GTC2010.pdf) if you would like to learn more. An example of a simple CUDA program can be seen below. The `main()` is essentially standard C/C++ except for the decoration of the invocation of the kernel function with `<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>` and the `__global__` keyword in front of the declaration of the kernel function indicating that this is a function that should run on the GPU. Multiple threads will be running the `add()` function in parallel and in the example below an operation such as `y[i] = x[i] + 0.5 * ( y[i+1] + y[i-1] )` would be a race condition and give undefined results.\n",
