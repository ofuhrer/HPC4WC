All these aspects are handled internally by GT4Py in a trasparent fashion. Particularly, when using the `gtx.gtfn_gpu` backend or embedded mode with `cupy` to run stencil computations on a GPU, GT4Py allocates and handles two buffers: one in CPU memory and one in GPU memory. The two buffers are exposed to the user as if they were a single memory address. The synchronization between them is carried out in a *lazy* fashion, thus avoiding useless memory transfers. If the user needs to operate on the storage from the CPU side, then data are automatically copied from the GPU to the CPU **if and only if** (theoretically...) the GPU buffer is *dirty*, i.e. if the GPU buffer has changed more recently than its CPU counterpart. Viceversa, when the storage is requested from the GPU side then data are transfered from the CPU to the GPU whenever the CPU buffer is dirty. This ensures that stencil computations are performed on the correct data. \n",

    "We already mentioned that in a GTScript function all computations must happen inside a computation block. Each computation block may traverse the vertical axis either in a parallel or sequential fashion. In the former cases, the horizontal planes can be visited in any order. This gives the compiler the complete freedom to scan the vertical dimension in the most efficient way. In the latter case, the computation block steps through the vertical levels either forward or backward. The vertical direction of a computation block is specified by the `computation()` context manager. Within a `computation()`, we may need to diversify the stencil calculations depending on whether we are close to the boundary or the inner region of the domain. The range bounds are set through the `interval()` context manager. We can nest multiple `interval()` contexts inside a `computation()` context, provided that the ranges do not overlap and fully cover the vertical axis."
