In the case of weather and climate models, domain decomposition typically refers to a split of the three-dimensation computational grid into a set of logical subdomains which are worked on by separate workers (MPI ranks). The coordination of the work is done by communication between the workers, typically via some form of message passing interface (MPI).\n",

    "Since the atmosphere is highly anisotropic, the grid spacing in the vertical is typically much smaller than in the horizontal. For example, in [COSMO-1](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/measurement-and-forecasting-systems/warning-and-forecasting-systems/cosmo-forecasting-system/cosmo-1-high-resolution-forecasts-for-the-alpine-region.html) the smallest vertical grid spacing is just 20 m whereas the horizontal grid spacing is 1100 m. In order to keep the timestep independent of the small vertical grid spacing, numerical methods in the vertical are often implicit leading to tightly coupled solvers (e.g. tridiagonal solvers) and not to stencil computations. As a result, the computational grid is typically not decomposed in the vertical (`k`) but only in the horizontal (`i,j`).\n",
