Since the 8 cores can work independently, the runtime is independent of the number of cores participating in the computation. We basically have a 8x speedup on 8 cores, which is really nice. An interesting experiment is to replace the arcsin(a) with simple a.copy(). One can see two things, the runtime goes significantly down (meaning that the the original version was not dominated by memory bandwidth concerns), and also the runtime between a single rank and 8 ranks is now significantly different."
