    "## von Neumann Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1945, [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), the first electronic general purpose digital computer was put to work. John von Neumann, a mathematician working on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US, became aware of the ENIAC computer and realized its potential to speedup the computations actual people were doing. He subsequently became deeply involved in the design of such computers and published an architecture still in use in modern computers which became known as the [von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "![von Neumann architecture](img/von_neumann_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The von Neumann architecture is based on the stored-program computer concept, where the instructions to be executed as well as the data are stored in a <font color=\"orange\">*memory unit*</font> which typically consists of RAM. The memory unit is connected to the <font color=\"blue\">*central processing unit (CPU)*</font> via a connection called a <font color=\"green\">*bus*</font>. The instructions need to be transferred to the *control unit* in the CPU in order to be executed. The control unit of each CPU understands a certain set of instructions. Load and store instructions are responsible for transferring data from and to the memory. The *arithmetic / logic unit* is responsible for operations on data, such as performing addition or multiplication."

Some components (e.g. memory) may have its own clock (see figure above). For example, in a simple CPU, an instruction is executed every clock cycle. In modern CPUs the situation is slightly more complex since engineers have found ways to design the chip in such a manner that it may be possible to execute multiple instructions in one clock cycle using techniques such as instruction pipelining or out-of-order execution. The metric measuring the number of *clock cycles per instruction (CPI)* is often reported when investigating the performance of a program.\n",

    "## Roofline model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roofline model ([Williams et al. 2009](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/963540)) is a simple and intuitive model that can give insight into how to improve the performance of a computer program or an individual kernel inside such a program. It shows the performance of the kernel in the context of hardware limitations (memory bandwidth, peak performance) and can help guide optimizations. The underlying assumption is that memory accesses or floating point operations are the dominant factors determining the performance of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a kernel is compute bound (limited by throughput of floating point operations), optimizations should target techniques such as vectorization, pipelining, better instruction mix, etc. If a kernel is memory bound (limited by reading and writing of data from and to memory), optimizations should aim at a reduction of memory transfers. The roofline model immediately shows how close to theoretical peak performance (the roofline) a kernel is. "
