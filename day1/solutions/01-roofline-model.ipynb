    "## von Neumann Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1945, [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), the first electronic general purpose digital computer was put to work. John von Neumann, a mathematician working on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US, became aware of the ENIAC computer and realized its potential to speedup the computations actual people were doing. He subsequently became deeply involved in the design of such computers and published an architecture still in use in modern computers which became known as the [von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture).\n",

    "![von Neumann architecture](img/von_neumann_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The von Neumann architecture is based on the stored-program computer concept, where the instructions to be executed as well as the data are stored in a <font color=\"orange\">*memory unit*</font> which typically consists of RAM. The memory unit is connected to the <font color=\"blue\">*central processing unit (CPU)*</font> via a connection called a <font color=\"green\">*bus*</font>. The instructions need to be transferred to the *control unit* in the CPU in order to be executed. The control unit of each CPU understands a certain set of instructions. Load and store instructions are responsible for transferring data from and to the memory. The *arithmetic / logic unit* is responsible for operations on data, such as performing addition or multiplication."

    "The CPU contains a [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate) which is responsible for synchronizing the operations of its components (see figure above). Some components (e.g. memory) may have its own clock (see figure above). For example, in a simple CPU, an instruction is executed every clock cycle. In modern CPUs the situation is slightly more complex since engineers have found ways to design the chip in such a manner that it may be possible to execute multiple instructions in one clock cycle using techniques such as instruction pipelining or out-of-order execution. The metric measuring the number of *clock cycles per instruction (CPI)* is often reported when investigating the performance of a program.\n",

    "The clock signal transitions from 0 to 1 and back to 0 and so on with a given frequency, the *clock frequency* or *clock rate*. The clock rate is measured in hertz (Hz). Common clock rates of modern CPUs are in the range of gigahertz (GHz)."

The underlying assumption is that memory accesses or floating point operations are the dominant factors determining the performance of a program.\n",
