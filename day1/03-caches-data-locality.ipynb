   "source": [
    "To understand how a computer program utilizes caches, it is important to know how data arrays are stored in the memory of a computer. Let's first look at how a one-dimensional data array `field(i)` is stored in memory. In the illustration below, `field` is of type `real (kind=4)` which is equal to `float32` or a floating-point value that occupies 4 bytes in memory. The elements of the array are stored consecutively in memory starting with the first element `field(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1d array](img/1d_array.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-dimensional array `field(i,j)` on has to choose in which order to store the elements. There are two choices. Either `field(2,1)` is the second element after `field(1,1)` (column major layout) or `field(1,2)` (row major layout), and so on. The illustration below shows column major layout, which is used in Fortran. Other languages (C or Python) use row major layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "![2d array](img/2d_array.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The important things to realize is that while the elements `field(1,1)` and `field(2,1)` are right next to each other in memory, the elements `field(1,1)` and `field(1,2)` can potentially be very far from each other in memory, depending on the size $nx$ of the first dimension (see [this page](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2018/12/28/what-is-the-fastest-axis-of-an-array) for more details). The jump in memory when moving from `f(i,j)` to `f(i+1,j)` is called *i-stride*. Similarly, the jump in memory when moving from `f(i,j)` to `f(i,j+1)` is called *j-stride*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In weather and climate models, the most important data arrays are three-dimensional `field(i,j,k)` where `i,j,k` correspond to the two horizontal and the vertical dimension. In our stencil program, we often chose `nx = 128`, `ny = 128`, `nz = 64`. It is a reasonable assumption that a weather and climate model has 64 vertical levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how much memory does such a field use in memory? If every value is stored as `float32` we use 4 bytes per value and have a total of `nx` x `ny` x `nz` values. That is a total of 4'194'304 bytes or 4.0 MBs.\n",

    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first iteration `i=1` we load `a(1)` and `a(2)` from system memory into L3, L2 and then L1. Oncde we have computed `b(1)` we move to the next `i=2` and here we need to load `a(2)` and `a(3)`. While `a(3)` has to come from system memory (RAM), `a(2)` is already in L1 cache. Simiarly, for `i=3` we have `a(3)` already in cache. Basically, for executing this loop, we only have to do 128 loads from system memory even though our programs issues 254 loads. We have a 50% L1 hit rate, since 50% of our loads can be satisfied out of L1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a Frotran program with two triply nested loops as shown below and our field sizes are `nx=128`, `ny=128` and `nz=64`. The first iteration of the first triply nested loop will read `a(1,1,1)` from system memory (RAM) into L3, L2, and L1 cache. This is a costly operation (>= 100 cycles, see above). Once we have the value `a(1,1,1)` we store it in `b(1,1,1)`. As we continue iterating through the first triply nested loop, more values of `a`, namely `a(2,1,1)`, `a(3,1,1)`, `a(4,1,1)`, ... come streaming into the caches. But at some point L1 is no longer able to keep a copy of `a(1,1,1)` and has to make room in favor of new data coming in (cache eviction). At a later point, also L2 is full and has to evict `a(1,1,1)` in favor of new data coming in. Since our full field `a` is 4 MB in total size, even L3 cannot retain `a(1,1,1)` as we are iterating through the first triply nested loop (in case all 12 cores are also all streaming in new data). By the time we reach the last element `a(nx,ny,nz)` of the first triply nested loop, `a(1,1,1)` is no longer present in any of the caches. So when we start the next triply nested loop, `a(1,1,1)` has to be loaded once more from RAM and we pay the high cost of having to load it twice.\n",
